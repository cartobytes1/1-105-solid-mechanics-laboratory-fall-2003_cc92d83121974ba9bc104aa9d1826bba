This course introduces students to basic properties of structural materials and behavior of simple structural elements and systems through a series of experiments. Students learn experimental technique, data collection, reduction and analysis, and presentation of results. Students generally take this subject during the same semester as [1.050](/courses/1-050-solid-mechanics-fall-2004), Solid Mechanics.
